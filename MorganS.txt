Soon your exploration leads you to the only other human being in the park. 
Standing in a ring of mushrooms is a young man.
He's the only other person at the park at this hour.
It has to be Morgan. 

As you approach he looks at you and in his eyes you see the very faintest glimpse of hope.
You stand in front of him and before you can get a word out, he starts what could only really be called venting:

[Morgan]I can't believe someone actually came...I've been here for a couple of days already...

Guess sitting in the middle of a fairy ring may have been a poor choice

You inspect him as he speaks, seeing little to no signs of wounds, he sees you scanning him and offers up a terse grin.

[Morgan]Yeah...turns out hurting yourself is painful!

He chuckles quietly to himself.

[Morgan] Who would have figured right?...I never really wanted to do anything...I was just so bitter.

Morgan looks past you and you can tell he is recalling some event in his past.

[Morgan] I do my best at work, I reach out to people, but nobody ever returns the favor...
I've somehow turned into a crotchety old man apparently.

[Morgan]How is that fair? I'm a good person! I call people, make plans, reach out to people who need help. Where are they?

[Morgan]For Chrissakes I'm in a park, standing the middle of a fairy circle. 
I've been missing for a couple of days! Not a single call, text or email!

He pauses to catch his breath. 

You wait a beat before asking

"Do you feel better?" 

[Morgan]Yeah...I do...I should probably head back, but thanks...if you hadn't come along I may have actually gotten angry enough to do something I'd regret.

[Morgan]Thanks...Hey, I never asked but...what's your name? Do you mind if I came around to talk to you every now and then?
